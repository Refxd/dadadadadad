# WoW Salvation - [EWT](https://ewtwow.com/subscribe) & [LuaBox](https://luabox.io) Supported!

Salvation is a addon for WoW that gives you a dashboard of all your online characters, as well as getting alerts when your characters are whispered (you can respond from the web-ui!). Alerts are handled by the [Pushover Service/App](https://pushover.net/) so make sure you grab that and support the developer as it's a great service.

Initially I wanted to build Salvation as a product centered around using Discord as the main means for interacting with the platform using a Discord Bot. After seeing other similar products come out to the community (that are charging absurd prices for a single character!) I decided to change my approach to this app, and to release it as a free open source project as the economics just didn't show it being worth charging for, so I am releasing it for free as a trimmed-down, self-hosted app! :)

Salvation is a self-hosted application, meaning there isn't a central service to use or account to create. Setup is super simple and the _recommended_ path is to use [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com) (awesome service and company) as the Glitch free plan can sustain roughly 2-4 characters max before hitting their rate limits. However, I do recommend paying for their membership which lets you "boost" applications (basically they run 24/7 and have no limits!). Paying means you could theoretically run hundreds of characters on a single intance of this app for cheaper than anyone else around. Or if you're a savvy technologist you can run it on your own hardware/servers/containers, etc. (go you!)
